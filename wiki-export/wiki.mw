Hades is a minimal Windows virtual machine designed for use with SolidWorks
(although the documentation here is almost entirely applicable to other use
cases). It is named after Hell itself, as that's what using Windows feels like
(in [[User:EllieClifford|Ellie]]'s humble opinion).

You are welcome to contribute [https://github.com/smh-my-head/hades here].

If you have all of the licenses required for Hades (being a student at
Cambridge is enough), drop [[User:EllieClifford|Ellie]] or
[[User:HenryFranks|Henry]] a message and we can pass on a working image (10GB).
Otherwise, have a look at
[[Hades#Install Hades from scratch|Install Hades from scratch]]. If you are
some sort of masochist and want to do it from scratch "for fun", we can send
you all the proprietary files necessary in one neat package (20GB).

= A Note on SolidWorks Network Licences =

Using this without a SolidWorks Network License contravenes the SolidWorks
licensing. However, this procedure does successfully convince SolidWorks that
it’s not in a VM. This is justifiable because there are artificial locks
against using “unsupported” hypervisors, so you couldn’t do it without tricking
SolidWorks even with the correct license.
