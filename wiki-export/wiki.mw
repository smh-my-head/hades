Hades is a minimal Windows virtual machine designed for using SolidWorks on
Linux. It is named after Hell itself, as that's what using Windows feels like
(in [[User:EllieClifford|Ellie]]'s humble opinion). Hades has been successfully
built for both SolidWorks 2018 SP03 and SolidWorks 2020 SP03.

{{Info|We are currently in the process of finalising the new image for
SolidWorks 2020.}}

If you have all of the licenses required for Hades (being a student at
Cambridge is enough), drop [[User:EllieClifford|Ellie]] or
[[User:HenryFranks|Henry]] a message and we will authorize you to access the
prebuilt image. Then see [[Hades#Install Hades with our image|Install Hades
with our image]]. The rest of this page is dedicated to installing and
optimizing Hades from scratch.

If you are some sort of masochist (read: Gentoo user) and want to do it from
scratch "for fun" despite having access to the prebuilt image, we can authorize
you to access the proprietary source files too.

= A Note on SolidWorks Network Licences =

Using this without a SolidWorks Network License contravenes the SolidWorks
licensing. However, this procedure ''does'' successfully convince SolidWorks that
it’s not in a VM. This is justifiable because there are artificial locks
against using "unsupported" hypervisors, so you couldn’t do it without tricking
SolidWorks even with the correct license. Please don't sue us.
